As an avid reader, I love having an app to track my reading habits, find books, and see what my friends are reading. I decided to redesign the Goodreads app because I have experienced firsthand some areas of improvement in the app. I conducted usability tests on the current Goodreads app, created personas and empathy maps based on listening sessions, admistered card sorts to help create a content structure, designed wireframes, a style guide, and mockups, and finally pitched my redesign to my class of 20 students as if I were pitching to the Goodreads product owners.",

The goal of the game is to find each salamander by finding physical image targets throughout the hospital and play mini-games to defeat them in order to ultimately save the world.

I have always loved hummingbirds, especially their bright colors, and I liked the idea of illustrating hummingbirds and the flowers they like. I researched information to get an idea for what categories I could include in the graphic. Then I created multiple sketches of layouts to help me narrow down which information to include. I decided to design the infographic as a magazine spread that would be in a nature magazine because I wanted to push myself to try a layout different from a traditional poster. I chose a serif font for the typography to fit the traditional magazine look. I created the layout in Adobe Illustrator and used rough sketches as placeholders for the illustrations. I digitally painted all the visual elements except for the map on my iPad in the Procreate app with the help of reference images. Finally, I added the illustrations into Illustrator and completed finishing touches.",
